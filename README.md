# Enterovirus_Mutation_Project

BACKGROUND: Enterovirus is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus associated with diseases such as hand-foot-and-mouth disease, myocarditis, and aseptic meningitis. Viruses often undergo drastic amino acid changes, or a change from one amino acid group to another (EX: amino acid change from Alanine, a hydrophobic amino acid, to Lysine, a positively charged amino acid), to increase virulence or avoid host detection. I focused on detecting drastic amino acid changes in genomic sequences for VP1 and VP2, structural proteins located at the surface of the viral capsid, for Enterovirus A, B, and C.

This project utilized R to analyze large FASTA genomic datasets of genetic data for VP1 and VP2 for various countries, including China, Denmark, and Japan, to determine whether drastic amino acid changes occurred within and between populations, and how those changes affected virulence.
