##Substr is a way to look at any range of positions of an element. This first line calls
# for the first position of the first element. However, "c" should not be the first
# position here (look at position 2 and 3 too). The first real nuc isn't shown until
# position 4. This is something that will need to be fixed to properly call nucs
substr(enterodata[1], 1, 1)
substr(enterodata[1], 2, 2)
substr(enterodata[1], 3, 3)
substr(enterodata[1], 4, 4)

##Table allows us to see the distribution of possibilities at a position in all of the
# elements. Positons 4 & 9 are the first and second nucletide positons. Most frequent!

#We are currently working on a for loop to go through all the elements in 
#our first fasta file to find what the wild NT is. 
#We’re still working on how to do this for the first 
#2 elements successfully so that we can apply it to 
#the rest of the elements in the data frame.
